-- Migration: Create Storage Bucket and RLS Policies (Alternative Approach)
-- Date: 2025-08-23
-- Purpose: Set up Supabase Storage for user file uploads WITHOUT modifying storage.objects directly
-- Note: This approach avoids ownership restrictions by using alternative methods

-- IMPORTANT: Create the storage bucket manually in Supabase Dashboard first
-- Go to Storage > Create a new bucket
-- Bucket name: user-uploads
-- Public bucket: false (private)
-- File size limit: 5MB
-- Allowed MIME types: text/*, application/pdf, application/msword, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document

-- Create a function to handle file cleanup when courses are deleted
-- This function will be called by a trigger and will use proper Supabase Storage API
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_orphaned_files()
RETURNS TRIGGER 
LANGUAGE plpgsql 
SECURITY DEFINER 
SET search_path = ''

    -- Construct the full file path for the user's folder
