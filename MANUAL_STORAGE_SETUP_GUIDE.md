# Manual Storage Setup Guide

## üö® **Why Manual Setup is Required**

The automatic migration approach failed because of ownership restrictions on the `storage.objects` table. Even with `SECURITY DEFINER` functions, we cannot modify this system table directly.

## üîß **Alternative Approach: Manual Dashboard Setup**

This guide will show you how to set up storage policies manually in the Supabase Dashboard, which bypasses the ownership restrictions entirely.

## üìã **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Create Storage Bucket**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Storage**
2. **Click "Create a new bucket"**
3. **Configure the bucket:**
   - **Name**: `user-uploads`
   - **Public**: `false` (private - this is crucial for security)
   - **File size limit**: `5MB`
   - **Allowed MIME types**: 
     - `text/*`
     - `application/pdf`
     - `application/msword`
     - `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`

### **Step 2: Run the Migration (Creates Helper Functions)**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. **Create a new query**
3. **Copy and paste** the content from `supabase/migrations/20250823000001_create_storage_bucket_and_policies.sql`
4. **Click "Run"**

This will create:
- `cleanup_orphaned_files()` function for automatic file cleanup
- `can_access_file()` function for file access validation
- `validate_file_upload()` function for upload validation
- Trigger for automatic cleanup when courses are deleted

### **Step 3: Create Storage Policies Manually**

After running the migration, go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies** and create these policies:

#### **Policy 1: Users can upload files to their own folder**
- **Target roles**: `authenticated`
- **Policy name**: `Users can upload files to their own folder`
- **Using expression**: 
```sql
bucket_id = 'user-uploads' 
AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'course-uploads'
AND (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
```

#### **Policy 2: Users can view their own files**
- **Target roles**: `authenticated`
- **Policy name**: `Users can view their own files`
- **Using expression**: 
```sql
bucket_id = 'user-uploads' 
AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'course-uploads'
AND (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
```

#### **Policy 3: Users can update their own files**
- **Target roles**: `authenticated`
- **Policy name**: `Users can update their own files`
- **Using expression**: 
```sql
bucket_id = 'user-uploads' 
AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'course-uploads'
AND (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
```

#### **Policy 4: Users can delete their own files**
- **Target roles**: `authenticated`
- **Policy name**: `Users can delete their own files`
- **Using expression**: 
```sql
bucket_id = 'user-uploads' 
AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'course-uploads'
AND (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
```

### **Step 4: Enable Row Level Security**

1. **Go to Storage** ‚Üí **Policies**
2. **Click "Enable RLS"** on the `user-uploads` bucket
3. **Verify all policies are active**

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### **Check Functions Created**
Run this SQL query to verify the helper functions were created:
```sql
SELECT 
  routine_name,
  routine_type,
  data_type
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('cleanup_orphaned_files', 'validate_file_upload', 'can_access_file')
ORDER BY routine_name;
```

### **Check Trigger Created**
Run this SQL query to verify the cleanup trigger was created:
```sql
SELECT 
  trigger_name, 
  event_manipulation, 
  action_timing, 
  action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'cleanup_files_on_course_delete';
```

### **Check Storage Policies**
Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies** and verify:
- RLS is enabled on `user-uploads` bucket
- All 4 policies are active
- Policy expressions are correct

## üöÄ **Expected Results**

After successful setup:
1. ‚úÖ Storage bucket `user-uploads` exists and is private
2. ‚úÖ Helper functions are created and functional
3. ‚úÖ Cleanup trigger is active
4. ‚úÖ RLS policies are active and secure
5. ‚úÖ Users can upload files to `course-uploads/{user_id}/` folders
6. ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup of orphaned files works
7. ‚úÖ File operations are properly secured per user

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### **If Migration Still Fails**
- **Error**: Function creation fails
  - **Solution**: Check if you have sufficient database privileges
  - **Alternative**: Create functions manually one by one

### **If Policies Don't Work**
- **Issue**: Users can't upload/view files
  - **Solution**: Verify RLS is enabled and policies are active
  - **Check**: Policy expressions match the folder structure

### **If Cleanup Doesn't Work**
- **Issue**: Orphaned files remain after course deletion
  - **Solution**: Check if the trigger was created successfully
  - **Verify**: Function has proper permissions

## üìö **How This Approach Works**

1. **Migration creates helper functions** that don't modify system tables
2. **Manual policy creation** in Dashboard bypasses ownership restrictions
3. **Helper functions provide validation** and cleanup capabilities
4. **Automatic cleanup** works through database triggers, not direct storage access

## üéØ **Benefits of This Approach**

- ‚úÖ **No ownership restrictions** - works with any user account
- ‚úÖ **Secure file access** - users can only access their own files
- ‚úÖ **Automatic cleanup** - orphaned files are removed automatically
- ‚úÖ **Flexible policies** - easy to modify in Dashboard
- ‚úÖ **No system table access** - avoids permission issues entirely

**Note**: This manual approach gives you the same security and functionality as the automatic approach, but bypasses the ownership restrictions that were causing the migration to fail.
