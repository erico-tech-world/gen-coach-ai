# GEN-COACH Documentation

## Overview
GEN-COACH is an AI-powered learning platform that generates structured courses, delivers engaging voice lectures, and interacts with learners in real time. It uses React + TypeScript on the frontend and Supabase for authentication, database, and Edge Functions. AI services are accessed via OpenRouter (DeepSeek) and Groq (for TTS).

## Architecture
- Frontend: React (Vite), shadcn/ui, Tailwind, TanStack Query, React Router
- Backend: Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Storage, Realtime)
- Edge Functions:
  - generate-course: creates course outline/modules using OpenRouter
  - lecture-mode: transforms module outlines into engaging lecture scripts with [CHECKPOINT] prompts
  - text-to-speech: calls Groq TTS to synthesize speech (returns base64 WAV JSON)
  - validate-test: validates answers (AI-assisted)
  - realtime-voice-chat: conversational assistant (browser speech recognition + AI)

## Data Model
- tables: profiles, courses
- courses fields: id, user_id, title, topic, modules (jsonb), youtube_links (jsonb), wikipedia_data (jsonb), progress, schedule, timestamps
- RLS: users can CRUD their own courses. Migration ensures delete policy.

## AI Flows
1. Course Generation (generate-course)
   - Input: prompt, userId, userName
   - Output: title, modules (with test), wikipedia/youtube context; saved into `courses`.
2. Lecture Mode (lecture-mode)
   - Input: outline (title + content), topic, optional wikipediaSummary
   - Output: long-form lecture text with [PAUSE] and [CHECKPOINT] markers; avoids emojis and reads pedagogically.
3. TTS (text-to-speech)
   - Input: text
   - Output: { success: true, audioContent (base64), contentType }
   - Implementation: chunked base64 conversion to avoid buffer issues; always returns HTTP 200 with success flag.

## Frontend UX
- CourseMaterialPage
  - Header responsive rework; progress badge inline.
  - On mobile, "Course Tools" and "Progress Summary" appear above content.
  - Play overlay and Listen button both trigger the same lecture flow.
  - Lecture flow: builds lecture text via `useAI.buildLecture`; sanitizes and chunks text; streams TTS chunks sequentially.
- CourseCreationOverlay
  - Shows 1â€“2 minute notice; after success, auto-refreshes to show new course.
- HomeScreen
  - Delete button with confirmation; uses `useCourses.deleteCourse`.

## Environment Variables
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY: for AI content generation and lecture mode.
- GROQ_API_KEY: for TTS.
- SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (Edge Functions only), project settings.

## Deployment Notes
- Deploy Edge Functions via Supabase UI by pasting code: generate-course, text-to-speech, lecture-mode, validate-test, realtime-voice-chat.
- Ensure verify_jwt = false where needed in Supabase function settings for public invocation.
- Run migrations in Supabase SQL editor as provided in `supabase/migrations/`.

## Updates in this Version
- TTS: robust chunked base64, 200 responses with success flag.
- Mobile UX improvements on CourseMaterialPage.
- Lecture mode Edge Function for engaging lectures and checkpoints.
- Listen/play unified; lecture text chunking and sanitization.
- Course creation UX: wait notice + auto-refresh.
- Delete confirmation + RLS policy migration.

## Roadmap
- Persist lecture progress per user to resume exactly from last checkpoint.
- Support streaming TTS responses.
- Rich confirmation modal instead of native confirm.
